# BLT Bonanza

BLT Bonanza is the perfect game to play when it's getting close to lunch time.  Move your plate around on the bottom of the screen to load up your slice of bread with as many yummy ingredients as you can fit -- but don't get too greedy.  If you stack your stack too high without finishing it off with another slice of bread, you'll lose your lunch!
